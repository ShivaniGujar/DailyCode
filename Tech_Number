	/*A Tech number is a number that can be split into two halves, 
	 * and the sum of the squares of each half is equal to the original number.
	 * Tech numbers are only valid when the number of digits is even.
	For example, 2025 is a Tech number because:
	•	Split 2025 into 20 and 25.
	•	20² + 25² = 400 + 625 = 1025, which is the same as 2025.
