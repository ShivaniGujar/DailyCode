/*Q1: Science Calculation Energy
 * write a program that calculates the energy needed to head to heat water
 * from a initial temp to a final temperature. Your program should prompt 
 * the user to enter the amount of water in kilogram and the initial and final
 * temperature of the water. The formula of compute the energy:
 *  Q = M * (finalTemperature -initialTemperature) * 4184; 
 *  where M is weight of water in kilogram, temperature are degree celcius, and
 *  energy Q is measured in joules  .
 *  water in kg==55.5 ,  initial temp=3.5, final temp=10.5 */
