/*Q5.Financial Application: Calculate Interest
 * If you know the balance and annual percentage interest rate,
 * you can compute the interest on the next monthly
 * payment using the formula
 * Interest = balance *(AnnualInterestRate /1200)
 * WAp that read the balance and annual percentage interest rate
 * and display the interest for  next month
 * ex: Enter balance =1000,interest rate 3.5 ,ans:2.91667*/
