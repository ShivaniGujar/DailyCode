/*Q2. Physics: finding runway length
 * Given an airplane acceleration a and take off speed v, 
 * you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane
 * to take off using the following formula
 * length= v2/ 2a
 * WAP that prompt the user to enter v in meter/second(m/s)
 * and the accelaration in (m per second square) and dispay minimum runway length
 * ex: minimum speed and acceleration: 60 3.5 ,minimum length of this runway is 514.286
 * */
