Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes n as a parameter and prints the number from 1 to n recursively.

Note: Don't print any newline, it will be added by the driver code.

Examples:

Input: n = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Input: n = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000



#############  Solution  ##########\
To print numbers from 1 to n without using loops, we can use recursion. The recursive function printNos() will print each number from 1 to n in sequence. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Define a base case: if n is less than 1, return to stop recursion.
First, make a recursive call to print numbers up to n - 1.
Once the base case is reached, each level of the recursion will print the current value of n.
Call	              Action	                                                      Output
printNos(10)        Calls printNos(9)	
printNos(9)	        Calls printNos(8)	
printNos(8)	        Calls printNos(7)	
printNos(7)	        Calls printNos(6)	
printNos(6)	        Calls printNos(5)	
printNos(5)	        Calls printNos(4)	
printNos(4)	        Calls printNos(3)	
printNos(3)	        Calls printNos(2)	
printNos(2)	        Calls printNos(1)	
printNos(1)	        Calls printNos(0)	
printNos(0)	n < 1, so return without printing (base case)	
Back to printNos(1)	Prints 1 after returning from printNos(0)	                        1
Back to printNos(2)	Prints 2 after returning from printNos(1)                        	1 2
Back to printNos(3)	Prints 3 after returning from printNos(2)	                        1 2 3
Back to printNos(4)	Prints 4 after returning from printNos(3)	                        1 2 3 4
Back to printNos(5)	Prints 5 after returning from printNos(4)	                        1 2 3 4 5
Back to printNos(6)	Prints 6 after returning from printNos(5)	                        1 2 3 4 5 6
Back to printNos(7)	Prints 7 after returning from printNos(6)	                        1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Back to printNos(8)	Prints 8 after returning from printNos(7)	                        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Back to printNos(9)	Prints 9 after returning from printNos(8)	                        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Back to printNos(10)	Prints 10 after returning from printNos(9)	                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
